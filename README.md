# hello-world
first repository
/* Second branch nested under first */

/* I'm Justin. Learned github in coders club the end of my sophmore year at 
CCSF but forgot 
it shortly after because I never actually developed anything. Not with a team, 
and not someone elses code 
  (all good opensource code is better than what a sophmore 
  cs major at city college can write [unless pre13370 {notice the autocorrect
  change putting 
      a dot before the open brace of this nested statement. That means it 
      thinks we're trying to 
      manipulate an unidentified object and work with some sort of indice for a 
      search, sort, or whatnot.
      )}
  ]) 
      
But do the periods all belong at the end in MLA? The I hope the world never cares,
or there is never a 
statement that reluctantly robust yet very inconcise.

P.S. The weird wrapping is me trying to feel out 80chars again. I used to be able
to get it down exactly.

This will branch from master once committed.
